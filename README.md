USB OTG File Reader is an app for Android to copy files from USB devices
connected via an OTG cable.

## Build

## The Story

On modern Android versions, USB devices are automatically recognized and
appear in the Android's Files app (or even on Total Commander). Unfortunately
I have a device that's not recognized (an XC Tracer Vario device).

I searched around for Android apps that support USB devices, and I even found
a few that recognzied my device. Unfortunately all apps were ad-ridden or used
in-app purchases to sell you something you don't need.

After some searching I found a library called [libaums](https://github.com/magnusja/libaums)
(short for Android USB mass storage) and experimented a bit with a
Xamarin.Android bindings project. After a bit fiddling with the library and
USB permissions, I got it working and decided to build a Xamarin.Android app
around it.

And here it is, an Android app that does one thing, downloading files from an
USB device connected via a USB-OTG cable. If you're also searching for such an
app, maybe your search has an end! Try it out, it's free, has no ads and no
in-app purchases.
